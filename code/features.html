	<p>
	This program enables users to create generalized cylinders <br>
	by prompting the user to draw the 'spine' of the GC.  <br>
	issuing a right-click will display and save the GC.   <br>
	The user can also load in GCs from previously saved object files.  <br>
	When a GC is displayed there is a surface normal toggle button which displays <br>
	the normals in red <br>  <br>
	
	The User can also change the shading type from smooth to flat as well as enable 
	specular shading. <br> <br>
	
	Update(lab3): lighting can be toggled by clicking on the yellow cube or the directional line and the view angle can change <br>
	Update(prog3): User controls to translate rotate and scale multiple objects. <br>
	Update(lab4):  Camera controls, make sure to change from orthographic to perspective when moving camera in +-Z<br> 
	BUGS: rotation controls are a bit off, but it does rotate in place</p>
